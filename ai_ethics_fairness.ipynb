    "### What is AI Ethics?\n",
    "\n",
    "AI Ethics refers to the moral principles and policies guiding the development and use of artificial intelligence systems. As AI becomes more integrated into society, there is a growing need to ensure that AI systems are fair, accountable, and transparent. Ethical AI systems are designed to prevent harm, reduce bias, and ensure that decisions made by machines are just and equitable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key areas of AI ethics include:\n",
    "1. **Bias and Fairness**: Ensuring that AI systems do not discriminate against individuals or groups.\n",
    "2. **Accountability**: Determining who is responsible for the actions and decisions made by AI systems.\n",
    "3. **Transparency**: Making the workings of AI systems understandable and interpretable by humans.\n",
    "4. **Privacy**: Protecting individuals' personal data in AI systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why AI Ethics is Important\n",
    "\n",
    "AI systems are increasingly being used to make decisions that affect people's lives (e.g., hiring, lending, criminal justice). Ensuring these systems are fair, transparent, and accountable is crucial for preventing harm and promoting social justice.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Bias in AI Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "AI models can inadvertently learn and perpetuate biases present in the data used to train them. This can lead to unfair outcomes, particularly for historically marginalized groups. Bias in AI can occur due to:\n",
    "- **Biased Data**: If the training data reflects historical inequalities or stereotypes, the model may learn and reproduce those biases.\n",
    "- **Model Bias**: The model itself may be biased based on how it is constructed or optimized.\n",

    "- **Equalized Odds**: Ensuring that the model's false positive and false negative rates are similar across different demographic groups.\n",
