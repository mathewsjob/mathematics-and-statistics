    "### What are GANs?\n",
    "\n",
    "Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are a class of neural networks used for generative tasks, such as generating images, videos, or other types of data. GANs consist of two main components:\n",
    "1. **Generator**: A neural network that generates fake data.\n",
    "2. **Discriminator**: A neural network that tries to distinguish between real and fake data.\n",
    "\n",
    "These two networks are trained together in a game-like scenario:\n",
    "- The generator tries to create realistic data to fool the discriminator.\n",
    "- The discriminator learns to differentiate between real and fake data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is for the generator to get better at generating realistic data, while the discriminator improves at detecting fake data.\n",
