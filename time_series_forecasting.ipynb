    "### What is Time Series Forecasting?\n",
    "\n",
    "Time series forecasting involves predicting future values based on previously observed data points over time. It is widely used in areas such as financial forecasting, stock market prediction, sales forecasting, and weather prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key components of time series data:\n",
    "- **Trend**: The overall direction of the data (upward, downward, etc.).\n",
    "- **Seasonality**: Regular, repeating patterns within the data (e.g., daily, weekly, yearly cycles).\n",
    "- **Noise**: Random fluctuations that do not follow a pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. ARIMA Model (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)\n",
    "\n",
    "ARIMA is one of the most widely used models for time series forecasting. It combines three components:\n",
    "- **AutoRegressive (AR)**: Uses the dependency between an observation and a certain number of lagged observations.\n",
    "- **Integrated (I)**: Represents the differencing of raw observations to make the time series stationary.\n",
    "- **Moving Average (MA)**: Uses the dependency between an observation and a residual error from a moving average model applied to lagged observations.\n",
