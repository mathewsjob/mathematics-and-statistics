    "\n",
    "Causation refers to a cause-and-effect relationship between two variables. While correlation measures the association between two variables, it does not imply causation. Just because two variables are correlated does not mean that one causes the other.\n",

    "### Correlation vs. Causation\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Correlation** is used to assess the relationship between features and the target variable or between different features.\n",
    "- **Causation** is crucial for understanding the true impact of one variable on another, which can be difficult to establish without controlled experiments.\n",
