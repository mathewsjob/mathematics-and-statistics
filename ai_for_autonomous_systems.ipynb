    "### What are Autonomous Systems?\n",
    "\n",
    "Autonomous systems are systems that can perform tasks without human intervention, using AI for decision-making, sensing, and control. These systems are used in various industries, such as transportation, robotics, and defense, and can make real-time decisions based on data from their environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key applications of AI in autonomous systems include:\n",
    "1. **Self-Driving Cars**: AI is used for perception, path planning, and navigation.\n",
    "2. **Drones**: AI-powered drones are used for tasks like surveillance, delivery, and mapping.\n",
    "3. **Robotics**: Autonomous robots use AI for object recognition, manipulation, and navigation in dynamic environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Perception in Autonomous Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "Perception involves using sensors (e.g., cameras, LIDAR, radar) to interpret the environment. AI models process sensor data to identify objects, obstacles, and other critical information needed for decision-making.\n",
