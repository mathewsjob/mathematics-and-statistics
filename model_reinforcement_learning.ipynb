    "### What is Reinforcement Learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment. The agent receives rewards or penalties based on its actions and tries to maximize the cumulative reward over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "In RL, the agent:\n",
    "1. **Observes** the current state of the environment.\n",
    "2. **Takes an action** based on its policy.\n",
    "3. **Receives a reward** and updates its knowledge.\n",
    "4. **Transitions** to a new state and repeats the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Components of Reinforcement Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Agent**: The learner or decision-maker.\n",
    "2. **Environment**: The world the agent interacts with.\n",
    "3. **State (S)**: A representation of the environment at a specific time.\n",
    "4. **Action (A)**: The choices available to the agent.\n",
    "5. **Reward (R)**: Feedback from the environment based on the agent's actions.\n",
