    "### What are Neural Networks?\n",
    "\n",
    "Neural networks are a class of machine learning models inspired by the human brain. They consist of layers of nodes (neurons), where each node performs a mathematical operation. Neural networks are particularly powerful for tasks like image recognition, natural language processing, and time series forecasting.\n",

    "1. **Input Layer**: Takes in the features of the data.\n",
    "2. **Hidden Layers**: Intermediate layers that apply transformations to the input data.\n",
    "3. **Output Layer**: Produces the final prediction (classification or regression).\n",
    "\n",
    "Each connection between nodes has an associated weight, and each node applies an activation function to determine its output.\n",
