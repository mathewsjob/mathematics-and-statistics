    "### What is Probability?\n",
    "\n",
    "Probability is a measure of how likely an event is to occur. It is a number between 0 and 1, where 0 indicates an impossible event and 1 indicates a certain event. The probability of an event \\( A \\) is denoted as \\( P(A) \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "0 \\leq P(A) \\leq 1\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sample Space and Events\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sample Space (S)**: The set of all possible outcomes of a random experiment. For example, if we toss a coin, the sample space is \\( S = \\{ \text{Heads}, \text{Tails} \\} \\).\n",
    "- **Event**: A subset of the sample space. For example, getting a \"Heads\" when tossing a coin is an event.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of Probability\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Classical Probability**: Based on the assumption that all outcomes are equally likely.\n",
    "   \\[\n",
    "   P(A) = \f",

    "   P(A) = \f",
    "rac{\text{Number of times A occurred}}{\text{Total number of trials}}\n",
    "   \\]\n",

    "\n",
    "### Conditional Probability\n",
    "\n",
    "The probability of an event \\( A \\), given that another event \\( B \\) has already occurred, is called conditional probability. It is denoted as \\( P(A|B) \\) and is calculated as:\n",
