    "### What is Natural Language Generation (NLG)?\n",
    "\n",
    "Natural Language Generation (NLG) refers to the use of AI to automatically generate human-like text. NLG is a subset of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and has applications in content generation, chatbot responses, summarization, and machine translation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key tasks in NLG include:\n",
    "1. **Text Generation**: Generating text based on input prompts or structured data.\n",
    "2. **Summarization**: Creating concise summaries from longer texts.\n",
    "3. **Machine Translation**: Translating text from one language to another.\n",
    "4. **Dialogue Systems**: Generating responses in chatbots and virtual assistants.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Text Generation with Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)\n",
    "\n",
    "Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are widely used for sequential data like text, where the output at each time step depends on previous time steps. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, a type of RNN, are commonly used for text generation tasks.\n",
