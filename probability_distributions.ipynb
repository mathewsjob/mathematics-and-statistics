    "A probability distribution describes how the probabilities of different outcomes are distributed for a random variable. It provides a mathematical description of the likelihood of different outcomes.\n",

    "There are two types of probability distributions:\n",
    "1. **Discrete Probability Distributions**: Used for discrete random variables (variables that take on specific values).\n",
    "2. **Continuous Probability Distributions**: Used for continuous random variables (variables that can take on any value within a range).\n",
