    "### What is AutoML?\n",
    "\n",
    "Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) is the process of automating the end-to-end process of applying machine learning to real-world problems. AutoML allows non-experts to use machine learning models and helps data scientists speed up the model-building process.\n",
    "\n",
    "AutoML automates tasks such as:\n",
    "- Data preprocessing\n",
    "- Feature engineering\n",
    "- Model selection\n",
    "- Hyperparameter tuning\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Use AutoML?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Efficiency**: AutoML saves time by automating repetitive tasks like hyperparameter tuning and model selection.\n",
    "- **Accessibility**: It enables users without deep expertise in machine learning to apply complex models to their data.\n",
    "- **Scalability**: AutoML can handle large datasets and complex problems efficiently.\n",
