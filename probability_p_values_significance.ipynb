    "\n",
    "The p-value is the probability of observing a test statistic as extreme as, or more extreme than, the one observed under the assumption that the null hypothesis is true. It helps us determine the strength of evidence against the null hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A small p-value (typically less than 0.05) indicates strong evidence against the null hypothesis, so we reject the null hypothesis.\n",
    "- A large p-value indicates weak evidence against the null hypothesis, so we fail to reject it.\n",

    "### Significance Level (\\( \u0007lpha \\))\n",
    "\n",
    "The significance level, denoted by \\( \u0007lpha \\), is the threshold below which the p-value must fall to reject the null hypothesis. Common choices for \\( \u0007lpha \\) are 0.05, 0.01, and 0.10.\n",
