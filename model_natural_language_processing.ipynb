    "\n",
    "Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of artificial intelligence that focuses on the interaction between computers and humans using natural language. The goal of NLP is to enable computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language in a way that is valuable.\n",

    "### Key NLP Tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Text Classification**: Categorizing text into predefined categories (e.g., spam detection, sentiment analysis).\n",
    "2. **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: Identifying entities such as names, locations, and dates in a text.\n",
    "3. **Language Modeling**: Predicting the next word in a sequence.\n",
    "4. **Machine Translation**: Translating text from one language to another.\n",
    "5. **Text Summarization**: Generating a concise summary of a longer document.\n",
