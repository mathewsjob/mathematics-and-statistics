    "### What is Federated Learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "Federated Learning is a machine learning technique where models are trained across decentralized devices (e.g., smartphones, edge devices) without sharing the data. Instead of sending data to a central server for training, the models are trained locally on each device, and only the updated model parameters are shared with the central server. The central server then aggregates these updates to improve the global model.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach enhances data privacy and security because raw data never leaves the device, and it reduces the need for large-scale centralized data storage.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Components of Federated Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Local Model Training**: Each device trains the model using its local data.\n",
    "2. **Model Aggregation**: The central server aggregates the model updates from all devices to improve the global model.\n",
    "3. **Privacy-Preserving Techniques**: Federated learning often incorporates techniques like differential privacy and secure aggregation to ensure data privacy.\n",

    "1. Each device trains a local model using its own data.\n",
    "2. Devices send only the model updates (not the data) to a central server.\n",
    "3. The central server aggregates the model updates and improves the global model.\n",
    "4. The updated global model is sent back to the devices for further training.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Federated Averaging Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Federated Averaging Algorithm** is commonly used to aggregate model updates in federated learning. It takes the average of the model parameters from all devices to update the global model.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Healthcare**: Federated learning allows hospitals to collaboratively train machine learning models without sharing sensitive patient data.\n",
    "2. **Mobile Devices**: Federated learning is used on smartphones to improve models like predictive text or voice recognition without sending user data to the cloud.\n",
    "3. **IoT (Internet of Things)**: Federated learning enables IoT devices to improve model accuracy locally without sharing raw sensor data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Benefits of Federated Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data Privacy**: Data stays on the device, reducing privacy concerns.\n",
    "- **Reduced Communication Overhead**: Only model updates are shared, not the raw data, reducing communication costs.\n",
    "- **Decentralized Learning**: Federated learning enables decentralized model training, making it scalable for large networks of devices.\n",
