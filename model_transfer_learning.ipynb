    "\n",
    "Transfer learning is a machine learning technique where a model developed for one task is reused as the starting point for a model on a second task. This is especially useful when the dataset for the second task is smaller, allowing the model to leverage learned features from the first task.\n",
    "\n",
    "Transfer learning is widely used in deep learning, especially for tasks like image classification, where pre-trained models (e.g., VGG, ResNet) are used as the starting point for new tasks.\n",

    "### Example: Transfer Learning Using a Pre-trained Model (VGG16)\n",
