    "### What is Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)?\n",
    "\n",
    "Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is a factorization of a matrix into three other matrices. It is a fundamental matrix decomposition method used in various applications in machine learning, such as dimensionality reduction, noise reduction, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given an m x n matrix \\( A \\), the SVD is represented as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[\n",
    "A = U \\Sigma V^T\n",
    "\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- \\( U \\) is an m x m orthogonal matrix (the left singular vectors).\n",
    "- \\( \\Sigma \\) is an m x n diagonal matrix with non-negative real numbers (the singular values).\n",
    "- \\( V^T \\) is the transpose of an n x n orthogonal matrix (the right singular vectors).\n",
    "\n",
    "### SVD in Machine Learning\n",
    "SVD is used in several machine learning tasks:\n",
    "- **Dimensionality Reduction**: By truncating smaller singular values, we can approximate the original matrix with fewer dimensions.\n",
    "- **Recommender Systems**: SVD is used in collaborative filtering-based recommendation systems.\n",
    "- **Noise Reduction**: SVD helps to reduce noise in data by focusing on the most important components (those with the highest singular values).\n",

    "1. SVD can be performed on any matrix (square or rectangular).\n",
    "2. The singular values in \\( \\Sigma \\) are always non-negative.\n",
    "3. The number of non-zero singular values gives the rank of the matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Applications of SVD\n",
    "- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: SVD can be used to compute PCA for dimensionality reduction.\n",
    "- **Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA)**: In natural language processing, SVD is used to uncover the underlying structure in text data.\n",
    "- **Image Compression**: SVD helps in reducing the size of images by representing them with fewer components.\n",
