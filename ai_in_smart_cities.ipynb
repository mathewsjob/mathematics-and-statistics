    "\n",
    "A smart city uses digital technology and data analytics to improve the quality of life for its residents. AI plays a crucial role in smart cities by enabling real-time decision-making, optimizing resources, and improving urban planning. AI-powered systems help manage traffic, energy, water resources, and public services efficiently.\n",

    "Key applications of AI in smart cities include:\n",
    "1. **Traffic Management**: AI is used to reduce congestion, optimize traffic flow, and improve public transportation.\n",
    "2. **Energy Efficiency**: AI helps optimize energy consumption in buildings, street lighting, and utilities.\n",
    "3. **Public Safety**: AI-powered surveillance and crime prediction systems enhance security.\n",
    "4. **Waste Management**: AI is used to optimize waste collection and recycling processes.\n",
    "5. **Sustainability**: AI supports urban planning efforts to make cities more sustainable and environmentally friendly.\n",
