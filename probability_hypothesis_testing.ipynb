    "### What is Hypothesis Testing?\n",
    "\n",
    "Hypothesis testing is a statistical method used to determine whether there is enough evidence in a sample of data to support a particular claim (hypothesis) about a population parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main hypotheses in hypothesis testing:\n",
    "1. **Null Hypothesis (\\( H_0 \\))**: The hypothesis that there is no effect or no difference.\n",
    "2. **Alternative Hypothesis (\\( H_1 \\))**: The hypothesis that there is an effect or a difference.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of hypothesis testing is to either reject the null hypothesis or fail to reject it, based on the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps in Hypothesis Testing:\n",
    "1. **State the Hypotheses**: Define the null and alternative hypotheses.\n",
    "2. **Choose a Significance Level (\\( \u0007lpha \\))**: The probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is actually true (common values are 0.05, 0.01).\n",
    "3. **Collect Data**: Obtain a sample and calculate the test statistic.\n",
    "4. **Make a Decision**: Compare the test statistic to a critical value or calculate a p-value.\n",
    "5. **Interpret the Results**: Decide whether to reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: Testing the Mean of a Population\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say we want to test whether the average height of a population is 170 cm. The null and alternative hypotheses are:\n",
    "\n",
