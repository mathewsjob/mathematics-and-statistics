    "### What is Integration?\n",
    "\n",
    "In calculus, integration is the process of finding the integral of a function, which is the reverse operation of differentiation. The integral of a function represents the area under the curve of the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "The indefinite integral of a function \\( f(x) \\) is denoted as:\n",

    "### Applications of Integration in Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Integration is often used in probability and statistics, which play a key role in machine learning. Some examples include:\n",
