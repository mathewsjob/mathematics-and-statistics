    "### What is AI in Healthcare?\n",
    "\n",
    "AI in healthcare refers to the use of artificial intelligence techniques, such as machine learning, deep learning, and natural language processing, to assist in medical diagnosis, treatment planning, and healthcare management. AI has the potential to revolutionize healthcare by improving accuracy, speed, and accessibility of medical services.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key applications of AI in healthcare include:\n",
    "1. **Medical Imaging**: AI models are used to analyze medical images (e.g., X-rays, MRIs) for disease detection and diagnosis.\n",
    "2. **Predictive Analytics**: AI is used to predict disease progression, patient outcomes, and treatment effectiveness.\n",
    "3. **Personalized Medicine**: AI helps tailor treatment plans based on individual patient characteristics.\n",
    "4. **Drug Discovery**: AI accelerates the drug discovery process by analyzing large datasets to identify potential drug candidates.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why AI is Transforming Healthcare\n",
    "\n",
    "AI can assist healthcare professionals by:\n",
    "- Enhancing diagnostic accuracy\n",
    "- Reducing administrative tasks\n",
    "- Providing real-time insights and recommendations\n",
    "- Improving patient outcomes through early detection\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. AI Applications in Medical Imaging\n",
    "\n",
    "Medical imaging is one of the most significant areas where AI is applied in healthcare. AI models, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), are used to analyze images and detect diseases such as cancer, pneumonia, and fractures.\n",
