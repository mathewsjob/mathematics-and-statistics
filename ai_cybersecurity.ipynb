    "### What is AI in Cybersecurity?\n",
    "\n",
    "AI plays a crucial role in cybersecurity by automating the detection of threats, analyzing vast amounts of data, and identifying security breaches. With AI, cybersecurity systems can quickly detect and respond to cyber-attacks, protecting organizations from potential threats. Key areas where AI is applied in cybersecurity include:\n",
    "- **Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)**: AI models monitor network traffic to detect malicious activity.\n",
    "- **Threat Intelligence**: AI analyzes threat data to identify potential vulnerabilities and attack patterns.\n",
    "- **Fraud Detection**: AI identifies unusual patterns in user behavior to detect and prevent fraud.\n",
    "- **Endpoint Protection**: AI is used in antivirus and endpoint security tools to detect malware and anomalous activity.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Anomaly Detection for Cybersecurity\n",
    "\n",
    "Anomaly detection is a key technique in cybersecurity that identifies unusual patterns in network traffic or user behavior that may indicate a cyberattack. Machine learning models are trained on normal behavior and flag deviations as potential threats.\n",
